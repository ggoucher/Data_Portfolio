## A Data Science Portfolio by Gerard Goucher

I am a Junior at Bowdoin College interested in the field of data science and software engineering. 
This repository contains the two projects that I have completed thus far, and I am actively working to complete more.

### Projects

I have worked on two projects thus far, outlined more in their individual folders...

**Marvel Superhero Wikipedia Analysis** - Project I worked on in and out of my *Computational Analysis of Big Data* course. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/ggoucher/Data_Portfolio/tree/master/marvel_superhero_project).

**MBTI Data Analysis** - Final project I worked on in my *Computational Analysis of Big Data* course. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/ggoucher/Data_Portfolio/tree/master/MBTI%20Final%20Project).
