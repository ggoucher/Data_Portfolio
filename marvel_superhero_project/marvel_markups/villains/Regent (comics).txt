==Fictional character biography==
===Earth-18119===
Augustus Roman is the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Empire Unlimited who operates as Regent. During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Regent rules over the [[Battleworld]] domain of the Regency. Heroes from all over the Battleworld domain of the Regency have gone missing. With the [[X-Men]] missing, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] suspect that Augustus Roman is behind this. As [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Secret Wars|Spider-Man]] hears of this, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] mentions about a mass-breakout at Ryker's Island. While the Avengers head out to fight Regent, Spider-Man heads home to meet with his wife [[Mary Jane Watson]] where he finds his daughter Annie in the clutches of [[Eddie Brock|Venom]]. Spider-Man brutally defeats Venom. As the superheroes are being defeated by Regent, Mary Jane Watson uses a fire truck's siren to help Spider-Man force Venom into a burning building and brings the structure down on Venom. With all the superheroes defeated by Regent, Peter Parker retires as Spider-Man to keep his family safe.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In light of Regent's victory, Peter Parker obtains inhibitor bracelets so that Regent won't detect him or Annie. Peter takes pictures of Demolition Man protesting the Regent's rule when he is defeated by [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]. As Peter distracts Regent's minions so that the Power Pack can escape, Mary Jane arrives and makes off with Annie. At Regent's headquarters, Regent figures out that Spider-Man has been sighted and unleashes his [[Sinister Six]] (consisting of [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], [[Mysterio]], Shocker, and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]) to hunt down Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Regent broadcasts that he will be doing a compulsory screening at Public School 122 Mamie Fay.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] appears and asks Peter Parker to come to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] with him as they are both subdued when Regent arrives. At Regent's base, Spider-Man and Sandman have been taken prisoner. After Regent reads Sandman's mind, he recruits [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], Boomerang, and Rhino to fill in the membership of the Sinister Six and sends them to attack the S.H.I.E.L.D. base.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As S.H.I.E.L.D. faces Regent, Mary Jane and Annie confront his scientists led by Dr. Shannon Stillwell. Using the same type of armor as Regent, Mary Jane helps Annie to disable the mechanism that held the captive heroes in order for Regent to draw in their powers. When this attracts the attention of Regent, Spider-Man escapes and takes the fight with Regent to the streets. Annie joined the fight and used the special arrowhead on Regent. Despite this, Regent is still a threat as he grabs Annie. Spider-Man uses a bluff to get close to Regent so that he can defeat him. Using an improvised restraining unit made by [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]], S.H.I.E.L.D took Regent into their custody as Spider-Man and his family resume their normal lives.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Earth-616 version===
Augustus Roman is the CEO of Empire Unlimited. However, he secretly adopted the identity of Regent, wearing a silver armor that changes his appearance to an armored one. Roman had felt abhorrence towards super-humans ever since his family died during a conflict between the Avengers and [[Helmut Zemo]]'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>As seen in ''Avengers Vol. 1 #277''. Marvel Comics.</ref> In order to contain and control the powers of the super-powered people, Regent built the Cellar at Ryker's Island. Any super-powered prisoner that is placed in the stasis tubes there have their powers replicated into Regent's suit like what had happened with [[Ox (comics)|Ox]] and [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]]. Dr. Shannon Stillwell tells Regent that Ox and Walrus' powers are average at best and it is just a start.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While out with [[Liz Allan]], [[Normie Osborn]], and Stanley Osborn, [[Harry Osborn|Harry Lyman]] witnesses Regent stopping a car that was fleeing the police. When Stanley asks him if he is Spider-Man, Regent introduces himself and states that he is a new superhero who is now watching over New York City.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] attacks an event at Empire Unlimited, he blasts Augustus Roman with a type of energy weapon. Though Roman was unfazed as Spider-Man and [[Iron Man]] arrive where they discuss who should fight Ghost. As this is happening, Roman slips away. As [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] is brought into the Cellar, Roman gives [[Betty Brant]] a tour of the Cellar where Betty mentions about the fact about Roman losing his family during an attack by the Masters of Evil. After Betty has left, Roman passes by the stasis tubes containing the inmates and is informed by Dr. Shannon Stillwell that they are full to capacity. Roman states that they must move on to the next phase. While Dr. Stillwell is hesitant about the next phase, Roman dons his Regent armor as he states that superpowers are the problem and not the supervillains. He will begin the next phase by targeting the Avengers.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When [[Orka (comics)|Orka]] attacks New York and plans to spill the contents of a [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] oil ship onto New York for the constant ocean pollution, Regent arrives where he quickly defeats Orka and burns the spilled oil. After Orka was placed in one of the stasis tubes in the Cellar, Dr. Shannon Stillwell states that Orka's [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] physiology has been transferred to him. Regent's computer then detects a fight between Iron Man and Spider-Man. When [[Miles Morales]] swings away from the fight, he is attacked and defeated by Regent who then places Miles in one of his stasis tubes. Dr. Stillwell states that the Avengers will come looking for him and that there is no turning back. After getting out of his Regent armor and going into the elevator, Augustus Roman encounters Betty who asks if he is Regent.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As [[Kamala Khan|Ms. Marvel]] is looking for Miles, she is taken down by Regent using Miles' camouflage and venom blast. Then he used Miles' camouflage and Ms. Marvel's elasticity to take out [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]]. Regent then uses Nova's high-speed abilities to take down [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]] and uses Ghost's weapon to take down [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. Dr. Shannon Stillwell warns Regent that he is putting his Regent armor to its limits as Regent ambushes [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thor]]. After his victory on Thor, Regent returns to the Cellar where Betty is imprisoned in one of the stasis tubes for getting to close to his plot. When Dr. Stillwell warns Regent of his vital signs, he states that he is fine and changes out of his Regent armor. Augustus Roman goes to meet with Harry Lyman who stated that his assistant contacted him about wanting to have an urgent meeting. He tells Roman that [[Parker Industries]] wanted the prison contract and that they would make special weapons for the Cellar if they went into business with Empire Unlimited. Roman declines stating that he doesn't care about the profits while voicing his knowledge on when Spider-Man fought [[Norman Osborn]] and later Harry when they each were [[Green Goblin]]. After mentioning how Parker Industries helped to reform [[Clash (comics)|Clash]], Harry asks him where Betty is. After getting some type of confirmation that Roman and Regent are the same person, Harry hits a button on his Webware. Spider-Man and Iron Man arrive at the Cellar where Regent fights them. Iron Man recognizes that he is copying the abilities of Miles, Ms. Marvel, and Ghost. After having been thrown off of Iron Man, Spider-Man has a theory that Regent's suit is using the same technology as [[Super-Adaptoid]]. As Dr. Stillwell warns Regent about his vitals and mentioning that Harry is being taken to a stasis tube, it is revealed that the latest stasis tubes are filled with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], members of the Avengers, members of the Avengers Unity Division (consisting of [[Brother Voodoo]], [[Deadpool]], [[Human Torch]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], and [[Synapse (comics)|Synapse]]), and members of the [[Squadron Supreme]] (consisting of [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] of Earth-13034, Blur of Earth-148611, [[Doctor Spectrum]] of Earth-429001, [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] of Earth-31916, and [[Thundra]]). Upon defeating Iron Man and Spider-Man, Regent declares himself as power incarnate and the only protector that humanity needs.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After learning that Regent has defeated Spider-Man and Iron Man, Mary Jane Watson opens a crate and dons the [[Iron Spider]] armor. Regent flies the unconscious Spider-Man and Iron Man back to the Cellar in energy bubbles. Dr. Shannon Stillwell states that they should do away with Harry Lyman and Betty Brant as people will start asking about what happened to the [[Chief operating officer|COO]] of Parker Industries. When Harry is thrown into a stasis tube, he uses an untested app on his Webware created by Clash to destroy the stasis tube. Mary Jane in the Iron Spider armor frees Spider-Man and Iron Man as they fight Regent. Mary Jane tells Spider-Man to help Harry while she helps Iron Man fight Regent who makes use of Human Torch's powers. After giving some web cartridges to Mary Jane, Spider-Man enters the Cellar. As Spider-Man rescues Harry, both of them free Miles Morales from his stasis tube as Regent feels the side effects of it. After Spider-Man, Harry, and Miles break more tubes, Regent feels the ground rumble as the Avengers, the Avengers Unity Division, the Squadron Supreme, and the X-Men (consisting of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], and [[Old Man Logan]]). Spider-Man then tells Regent that both the easy way and the hard way have the same results. Regent is imprisoned in the Cellar where different heroes take turns guarding him until they are sure they can imprison him here while the villains he had in the tubes will make abuse claims to get out of the Cellar much to Iron Man and Spider-Man's disdain.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Regent appears as a member of Baron Zemo's Army of Evil. He assists in the attack on Manhattan in light of [[Avengers: Standoff!|what happened in Pleasant Hill]].<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
Regent appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Imari Williams]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Brand New Day|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=45|airdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref> While he serves as the warden of The Cellar, he is also depicted as the mentor of [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)|Yuri Watanabe]]. He first appears in the episode "Brand New Day" where he is contacted by Yuri to help prove to Spider-Man that [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Mister Negative]], [[Molten Man]], Sandgirl, and [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] are still locked up in the Cellar after Spider-Man claims they captured Iron Man, Hulk, Ms. Marvel, Captain America and Black Widow one-by-one. With help from his assistant '''Shannon Stillwell''' (voiced by [[Kathreen Khavari]]), Roman proves to Spider-Man that not only are the suspected villains (along with Dagger and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]]) indeed in their cells, but also the cells themselves drain away their powers. Upon making a new suit to help him, Spider-Man continues the investigation on his end. Following a Spider-Tracer he previously put on Black Widow when she was captured, Spider-Man becomes ambushed by Regent, who uses Dagger, Electro, and Molten Man's powers during the fight as well as the powers of three villains he never encountered before. When Regent starts using Cloak's powers, Spider-Man tries to use an ion device only to instead be transported to an unknown dimension that the missing Avengers are being held captive in. In the episode "The Cellar", Spider-Man is able to escape Regent's pocket dimension and meets up with Yuri, and describing the powers Regent used as well as the three he hasn't encountered, Yuri identifies that the three abilities belong to inmates Frostbite, Whirlwind, and Paradox. Arriving at the Cellar, Roman gives Spider-Man a tour while Yuri takes Stillwell in to be interrogated after discovering evidence of suspected involvement with Regent. When Spider-Man finds Cloak, Roman reveals his Regent activity to them. Regent explains that his plan for the Avengers was to make them pay for arresting his father, who as a result is now serving life sentence. To Roman, his father's crimes were seen as only a few felonies. During the battle, Cloak manages to escape when his cell is damaged and allies with Spider-Man. Then, with unexpected help from [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] and [[Anna Maria Marconi]], Dagger is released from her cell and also allies with Spider-Man. Having been told by Octavius how to stop Regent, and figuring out that Regent's pocket dimension is really part of Cloak's powers, Dagger risks her life to give a weakened Cloak the strength needed to free the captive Avengers. Once freed, they and Spider-Man defeat Regent, who is later stated by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to have been remanded to his own prison.
