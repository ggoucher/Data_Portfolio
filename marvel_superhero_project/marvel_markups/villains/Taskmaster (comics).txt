'''Taskmaster''' ('''Tony Masters''')<ref name="Taskmaster vol. 2 #3">''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #3</ref> is a [[fictional character|fictional]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #195 (May 1980), created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[George Pérez]]. Normally a [[supervillain]] but sometimes an [[antihero]] and a [[sleeper agent]], Taskmaster went on to feature in numerous Marvel titles, most notably as a mercenary hired as a training instructor by various criminal organizations.

Taskmaster will appear in the upcoming film ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020), set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Publication history==
The Taskmaster first appeared briefly in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #195 (May 1980), created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[George Pérez]].<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 197|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Created by writer David Michelinie and artist George Pérez, Taskmaster could mimic any physical skill he had ever seen.}}</ref> making his full debut in ''Avengers'' #196 (June 1980). <ref name="CBTaskmaster" />

The Taskmaster appeared in his own limited series ''Taskmaster'' #1–4 (2002), which was followed by a supporting role in ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #1–15 (2002–2003). The character went on to feature prominently in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' as a supporting character in #8–19 (2008–2009) and ''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1 (2008) then later as a central character in #20–35 (2009–2010) during the [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] and [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] storylines. ''Age of Heroes'' #3 (2010) provided the prologue for the Taskmaster's second limited series ''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #1–4 (2010–2011). In 2011 Taskmaster got his first solo graphic novel collecting a four-issue story—''Taskmaster: Unthinkable''.

Following [[Marvel NOW!]], Taskmaster joined a new team of Secret Avengers.<ref name="CBTaskmaster">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/07/22/black-widow-who-is-taskmaster/|title=Black Widow: Who Is Taskmaster?|last=Lovett|first=Jamie|website=Comicbook|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723140950/https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/07/22/black-widow-who-is-taskmaster/|archivedate=July 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Taskmaster injected himself with [[Hauptsturmführer|SS-Hauptsturmführer]] Horst Gorscht's primer, an elaborate modification of the adrenal steroid [[cortisol]] designed to unlock the mind's [[procedural memory]] potential. The Taskmaster thus gained the ability to absorb knowledge instantaneously. This ability is linked to his [[muscle memory]], allowing the Taskmaster to instantly replicate the physical movement of peak-level humans. Using these "photographic reflexes", the Taskmaster is highly skilled in various forms of combat, as an exceptional martial artist (mimicking [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Shang-Chi]]), a skilled swordsman ([[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], [[Silver Samurai]], [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]), a deadly accurate marksman ([[Captain America]] with a shield, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] with a bow and arrow, [[Punisher]] with firearms, and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] with various projectiles) as well as displaying a strenuously honed athletic ability ([[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]). Once the Taskmaster has mastered an opponent's physical movements, he can then predict his opponent's next attack. The only person shown capable of negating Taskmaster's abilities is [[Deadpool]], whose manic personality makes him nearly impossible to predict.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #2</ref> A side effect of the primer is severe [[declarative memory]] loss. The more implicit memories (i.e. knowledge and abilities) he learns, the more explicit memories (i.e. personal experience) he loses. Because of his explicit memory loss, the Org (Mercedes Merced) has acted as Taskmaster's surrogate memory, his banker, and his handler for his entire criminal career.<ref name="Taskmaster' 2011"/>

By viewing a video in fast-forward, the Taskmaster can learn to replicate human movement at near-superhuman speed. However, this puts his body under intense strain and can only be used for short periods of time. He also has the ability to manipulate his vocal cords to mimic the voices of others. The Taskmaster was once shown to have [[aquaphobia]] (the fear of water), but later overcame his fears.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 1 #1–4 (2002)</ref>

===Weaponry===
As he is able to replicate numerous fighting techniques, the Taskmaster carries an extensive arsenal of weapons on his person, most commonly using a sword and a replica of Captain America's shield. He also carries a bow and a quiver of arrows, a billy club, a lasso, [[nunchaku]], throwing darts, and various firearms. The Taskmaster once used a stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. device that was able to create various forms of weaponry (such as arrows and shields) using solid energy.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 1 #1 (2002)</ref>

==The Org (Mercedes Merced)==
The Org is the secret criminal underground that links all criminal and terrorist organizations. In reality, Mercedes Merced is the Taskmaster’s S.H.I.E.L.D. handler, posing as the Org and the Hub (the voice of the Org), to guide him through his memory loss and gather intelligence on the criminal underworld. Mercedes is also the Taskmaster's wife, having been happily married while they were both [[List of S.H.I.E.L.D. members|agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]] As a result of the Taskmaster's powers, his explicit memories of Mercedes were lost, and had no recollection of being married.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

When S.H.I.E.L.D. was shut down by [[Norman Osborn]], Mercedes went rogue and continued her role as her husband's handler. However, when a billion-dollar bounty was placed on the Taskmaster's head by someone claiming to be the Org, Mercedes was forced to break her cover and battle alongside her husband against Redshirt and the Minions' International Liberation Front. Once their enemies were beaten, and the Taskmaster once again forgot who she was, Mercedes mournfully returned to her previous role.<ref name="Taskmaster' 2011">''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #1–4 (2010–2011)</ref>
