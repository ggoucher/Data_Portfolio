==Fictional character biography==
'''Wendy Conrad''' was born in [[Scarsdale, New York]]. She used her juggling talents and explosives expertise to become the supervillain Bombshell. Bombshell, along with juggler [[Oddball (comics)|Oddball]], was hired by [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] to eliminate [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. The two juggling supervillains were able to subdue the two heroes and deliver them to Crossfire. However, Hawkeye later managed to escape and defeat all three villains.<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.1 #3-4</ref>

Bombshell and Oddball, together with [[Knickknack (comics)|Knickknack]], [[Ringleader (comics)|Ringleader]] and [[Tenpin (comics)|Tenpin]], formed the juggling-themed [[Death-Throws]] supervillain group. The group were hired by Crossfire to help him escape from prison. When Crossfire was unable to pay them, the Death-Throws held the villain hostage. They were defeated by Hawkeye, Mockingbird and [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #317</ref> Later, the Death-Throws attempted to claim the bounty placed on Hawkeye's right arm but were defeated by Hawkeye, Mockingbird and [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #23-25</ref>

Bombshell underwent a genetic experiment to gain superpowers. She gained the ability to fire explosive energy blasts from her hands. Bombshell then joined an all female team of supervillains called the [[Femizons]]. The female team, led by [[Superia]], sought to sterilize all men so women would rule the world. The team was defeated by Captain America. Bombshell's experimental new powers soon faded.<ref>''Captain America'' #389-392</ref>

[[Justin Hammer]] hired a number of supervillains (including Bombshell) to battle [[Spider-Man]] and the [[New Warriors]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Annual #12</ref> Hammer and the supervillains allied themselves with the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]].<ref>''[[Web of Spider-Man]] Annual'' #8 (1992)</ref> When Sphinx revealed his true intentions of world domination, Bombshell panicked and fled from the scene.<ref>''New Warriors'' Annual #2</ref>

The Death-Throws are hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Splinter groups|R.A.I.D]] to take part in a terrorist attack on [[London]]. They attack civilians from the top of [[Tower Bridge]], but soon come into battle with [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] and [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]]. Bombshell, the last member of the team left standing, defuses her bombs and surrenders.<ref>''Union Jack'' Vol.2 #2</ref> Union Jack uses one of Bombshell's bombs (which he had earlier confiscated) to take down a giant [[Dreadnought (comics)|Dreadnought]].<ref>''Union Jack'' Vol.2 #4</ref>

==Ultimate Marvel==
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation is originally a mother/daughter criminal team called the "Bombshells" ('''Lori Baumgartner''' and '''Lana Baumgartner'''). They have the ability to fire explosive energy beams from their hands. In their first appearance, the foul-mouthed Bombshells attempt to rob a bank vault but are foiled by the original [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker).<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #2</ref> Later, they attempt to rob an armored truck until the [[Human Torch (comics)|Human Torch]] and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] arrive on the scene and defeat them.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #9</ref> 

They were originally believed to be mutants whose powers activated when close to one another, but it's later revealed that their powers are the result of experiments carried out by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Corporation]] while Lana was in-utero. Lori's pregnancy was not noticed until after the experiments and the discovery prompted Lori to forcibly terminate her contract as a test subject utilizing her powers.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #26</ref> Lana, having been released on juvenile parole, later teams up with Spider-Woman, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak & Dagger]] and the new [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] (Miles Morales) as an [[Young Avengers|amateur superhero team]] to take down Philip Roxxon.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #28</ref> After Roxxon is arrested, Lana has a moment of clarity and realizes that she is supposed to be a superhero. It is also revealed that Lana was forced into crime by her mother.<ref>''Cataclysm: Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #1</ref> 

As a consequence of the reality-ending phenomena known as [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]], Lana's entire universe came to an end. One of the few survivors of the universe was Miles Morales. After Miles helped an [[Molecule Man|omnipotent being]], who was keeping a composite world called Battleworld together,<ref>''Ultimate End'' #5</ref> he was repaid by bringing his family and friends into Earth-616, in such a way it was as if they had always lived their entire life there.  Lana, and her mother, were among the people brought to Earth-616.<ref>''Spider-Man'' (2016) #3</ref> Since then she has acted as both a super-hero and super-villain at different times. <ref>''Spider-Man'' #234</ref>
