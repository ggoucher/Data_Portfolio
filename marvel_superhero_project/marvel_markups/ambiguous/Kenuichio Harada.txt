==Powers and abilities==
Kenuichio Harada was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to generate a [[tachyon]] field, with which he could surround anything{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. He commonly uses his power on his sword, enabling it to cut through nearly anything, except substances as hard as [[adamantium]]. When working with the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], Kenuichio possessed a [[teleportation]] ring, which allowed him to teleport from one location to another, granting him great mobility and stealth. As a self-styled samurai, he was a master of [[kenjutsu]] and other martial arts. Kenuichio specialized in edged weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and [[military tactics]]. He usually wore a suit of lightweight steel alloy body armor, modeled after traditional samurai armor, but made of modern protective materials. He carried a katana (long sword), shuriken (throwing stars), and other weaponry. Keniuchio had extensive knowledge of the operations of criminal organizations due to his shady past, which he used in the service of his government to combat such organizations. He was an expert in the history and customs of the samurai class ([[Bushido]]).

He wore no helmet and had a red upside down Omega symbol tattooed on his forehead. Because he wears no helmet, it is probably a ''maedate'', the crest of a Samurai [[kabuto]]. He was one of the team's more visible members, rash yet strong. It was revealed that the Silver Samurai and Wolverine met each other in Japan, some time before Logan rescued Mariko from thugs. He was aware of the existence of [[Psylocke]], a rare telepath , but how the Silver Samurai was convinced to join [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Age of Apocalypse|Magneto]]'s X-Men in the first place was not explained.<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' #1–6. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was much later reported by the ''Age of Apocalypse'' version of [[William Stryker]] to have been killed in action while defending the last human stronghold from the forces of the now crazed ''Age of Apocalypse'' version of Wolverine.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

===Exiles===
In ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #83 (August 2006), another alternate version of the Silver Samurai was revealed. Originating from Earth-172, the Silver Samurai appeared to have a nice relationship between [[Mariko Yashida]] and that Earth's Wolverine who was a briefly seen member of the reality-hopping counterpart team of the Exiles called [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]]. Wolverine had vanished out of their sight for months to join the said team, and was later killed in action and returned by the Exiles to his home world. The Silver Samurai and Mariko of that alternate world still don't fully know what happened to their version of Wolverine, but honored the man's death with a proper funeral by burning Logan's ashes via cremation.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

At the fight of the warehouse near the docks, he knocked out [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] with a shuriken loaded with knock-out gas. The unnamed Yakuza leader breaks up the fight and says that they'll have a non-mutant ability duel as part of the samurai code by the next night. When they duel, Silver Samurai mentioned that Mariko meant nothing to him and that he had only married so that Logan could not. Logan once again was superior over Silver Samurai and demanded that Harada yield the fight. Harada started acting dishonorably by using his mutant abilities to attack Logan before being hit with a knockout gas-filled shuriken. The Yakuza leader forfeited the duel declaring that Harada deliberately violated the samurai code and has him taken away. After the Yakuza leader agreed to release the X-Men, Mariko mentions to Logan that Harada will be driven out from the Yakuza in shame and that he'll never be admitted again.
