## Marvel Superhero Project

This project dissects the makeup of characters in the Marvel Superhero universe utilizing Wikipedia data. 

First, we will have to parse through the superhero data by acquiring and cleaning Wikipedia markups. Then, we can move onto visualization and analysis. By utilizing visualization tools in Python, we can draw out some interesting trends regarding Heroes and villains, and also find a third category of character, the ambiguous character. We will then train ML classifiers on our data and predict the allegiances of our ambiguous characters.
