## Myers-Briggs Personality Typing 

This group project focuses on a Kaggle dataset from the PersonalityCafe forum. It pairs user MBTI personality types with their last 50 posts.

Our group sought to determine some of the significance of these personality types. Using various visualization tools, we were able to notice differences between the personality types. Furthermore, utilizing sentiment analysis provided some interesting insight on the overall outlooks of each type. Finally, we decided to see if we could train ML classifiers on the data. We were able to do this successfully, and found some interesting results.
